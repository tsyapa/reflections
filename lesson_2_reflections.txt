What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository the new folder .git in your folder are created.
This repository contains the metadata with history of the commits


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an interim step to the repository. In case of having many
files to commit we can add each file to the staging area when it is ready to
commit and then commit all of them in one touch. As a result, we don't make
too many commits.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help? 

If you want to try some features that you don't sure they would work, you can
create a new branch and make it there. As a result, you can try something new
and don't spoil a master branch with bad commits.
